## DEN INTERNSHIP TASKS AND PROJECTS OVERVIEW
This repository contains the projects and tasks completed during my six-week internship at Digital Empowerment Network, focusing on implementing various systems and tools in C++.
### TASK 1: Weather Forecast And History System
---
### *OBJECTIVE*:
Provides a  Weather Forecast And History System for managing locations, weather variables, and historical data, including functionalities for fetching, displaying, and exporting weather information.
+ *DESCRIPTION*:
  - A comprehensive weather forecasting and historical data retrieval tool developed in C++.
  - Integrates with APIs to fetch real-time weather data and retrieve historical weather records for multiple locations.
  - Utilizes libcurl for API requests and nlohmann/json for handling JSON data.
  - Allows users to define weather variables, manage locations, and export data in both CSV and JSON formats.
+ *KEY STEPS* :
  - Defining a Location class with attributes for name, latitude, and longitude, and managing a static list of locations.
  - Implementing functions to add, remove, and list locations using the Location class.
  - Defining a WeatherVariable class to handle weather-related variables, including functionality for defining, updating, and displaying these variables.
  - Using curl for fetching real-time weather data from an API and displaying it.
  - Implementing WeatherForecastingSystem for exporting weather data to CSV and JSON formats.
  - Creating a HistoricalWeatherSystem to simulate fetching historical weather data and exporting it to CSV and JSON formats.
  - Providing a menu-driven interface for user interaction, including managing locations, weather variables, and exporting data.
+ *TECHNOLOGIES USED*: C++, libcurl Library, nlohmann/json Library, fstream, API
+ *OUTCOME*: Accurate weather forecasting, seamless data exports, and a robust interface for managing weather variables and locations.

  ### TASK 2:Contact Management System
---
### *OBJECTIVE*:
Implement a simple system to manage contacts demonstrating basic object-oriented programming concepts like classes, vectors, and user input handling.
+ *DESCRIPTION*:
  - C++ program that allows users to add, view, anddelete contacts.
  - Each contact should have a name and a phone number.
+ *KEY STEPS* :
  - Defining a Contact class with appropriate attributes.
  - Using vectors to store contact objects.
  - Implementing functions for adding, viewing, and deleting contacts.
  - Providing a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
+ *TECHNOLOGIES USED*: C++,OOP,Standard Template Library (STL).
+ *OUTCOME*: The system provides a simple, interactive way to manage contacts, demonstrating core OOP principles and dynamic data handling with C++.
